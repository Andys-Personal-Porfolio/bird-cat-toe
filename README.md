# Bird-Cat-Toe


## Overview of project and goals
My goal was to be able to build a project from scratch using html, css, and JavaScript that allows users to play a game of Bird-Tac-Toe. I wanted to learn how to make a page that looks nice as well as functions properly. I was especially interested in the game logic and making it as simple as possible.
## Overview of technologies used, challenges, and wins, any other reflections
I used classes, switch statements, created elements in JavaScript, and other technologies. The biggest challenge was localStorage, I wanted to be able to have the players be instantiated inside of the game class but I could not understand how to instantiate them once gotten back from localStorage. I worked around this by having them instantiated in the data model, not ideal.
